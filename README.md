# A sleek Pomodoro clock

(Part of [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) challenges)


This app was made using Jade(Pug), Sass (with bootstrap 4), and JavaScript (with jQuery). <br>

## What is this app?

This Pomodoro Clock is based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). <br>
It is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. <br>
The timer has *2 phases*, usually a 25 minutes work phase , and a 5 minutes break phase. Theses phases are called *pomodoros*.

## How to use the clock?

- First, set the work and break duration using the + and - on the bottom counters.

- Then start the clock using either the main button, or by clicking on the clock.

- You can pause the clock by clicking on the clock.

- Clicking the button will stop and reset the clock.

- When a phase is finished, the clock automatically switch to the next phase. <br>
You can see in which phase you are by looking at the icon above the bottom counters. The current phase is *white with a black icon*.

- The left counter (coffee icon) represent the break phase. <br>
The right counter (clock icon) represent the work phase.

***You cannot change the phases duration once the timer has started.***
