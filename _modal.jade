        h5 What is this app?
        p This Pomodoro Clock is based on the 
          a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique") Pomodoro Technique.
          br
          | It is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
          br
          | The timer has 2 phases, usually a 25 minutes work phase , and a 5 minutes break phase.
          | Theses phases are called pomodoros.
